# Chess-Questers

A turn-based rogue-lite RPG where your adventurers move on a 2D grid like chess pieces!
Written in C#/Unity and built on a scriptable-object architecture.

Begin your quest with three randomly generated adventurers. Each one gets a class and then a set of random actions - one move and two attacks.
